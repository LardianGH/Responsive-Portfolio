                    <p id = rightText>My name is Zion Austin Brown, and I am currently a student of the UNC Charlotte 
                        Full-stack Coding Bootcamp. I was born in California and moved to North Carolina in 2009. 
                        Here I attended Reedy Creek elementary-school, Northridge middle-school, and Queen's Grant high-school
                        <br>
                        I live in Charlotte, Mecklenburg county.

                <p class = underText>I have experience in <b>Visual Basic</b> and <b>Javascript</b> so far 
                    and I am determined to do the best I can and try my hardest during the Bootcamp, 
                    I will learn as much as possible and will continue to learn after graduation.

                    Some extra information is I own two cats (Darth-Vader, and Ginger), They are good kitties. 
                    I play computer games and was thinking of getting an occulus quest in the future
                    (maybe when I'm not completely broke).
