                         having a snow-covered dinner. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.
                          You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.
                           You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. If you hypnotize it,
                            it will go away. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.
                             We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.
                              I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. 
                              Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?

                <p>This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Let's put some happy 
                    little clouds in our world. Isn't that fantastic?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let your imagination be your guide. You need the dark in order to show the light. It's life.
                     It's interesting. It's fun. All kinds of happy little splashes.
